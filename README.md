# jgenesis

Cross-platform multi-console Sega emulator that supports the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, the Sega CD / Mega CD, the Sega Master System, and the Game Gear.

## Features

* Emulation for the following consoles:
  * Sega Genesis / Mega Drive
  * Sega CD / Mega CD
  * Sega Master System / Mark III
  * Game Gear
* GPU-based renderer with integer prescaling and optional linear interpolation
* Configurable pixel aspect ratio for each console with several different options: accurate to original hardware/TVs, square pixels, and stretched to fill the window
* Support for the Sega Master System FM sound unit expansion
* Support for both 3-button and 6-button Genesis controllers
* Support for keyboard controls and DirectInput gamepad controls
* Save states, fast forward, and rewind
* Some simple horizontal blur and naive anti-dither shaders for blending dithered pixel patterns, which were extremely common on these consoles due to limited color palettes and lack of hardware-supported transparency
* Optional 2x CPU overclocking for Sega Master System and Game Gear emulation

TODOs:
* Emulate the Genesis VDP FIFO, in particular the fact that the CPU stalls if it writes to VRAM too rapidly during active display. A few games depend on this to function correctly (e.g. _The Chaos Engine_, _Double Clutch_, _Sol-Deace_), and a few other games have graphical glitches if it's not emulated (e.g. the EA logo flickering for a single frame, parts of the _Batman Returns_ intro running too fast)
* Support 24C64 EEPROM chips (used only in _Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball_ and _College Slam_)
* Support the Sega Master System's additional graphics modes (Modes 0-3); only one officially released game used any of them, _F-16 Fighter_ (which uses Mode 2)
* Support multiple Sega CD BIOS versions in GUI and automatically use the correct one based on disc region
* Support CHD files for Sega CD in addition to BIN/CUE

## Dependencies

### Rust

This project requires the latest stable version of the [Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) to build.

### SDL2

This project requires [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) core headers to build.

Linux (Debian-based):
```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

macOS:
```
brew install sdl2
```

### GTK3 (Linux GUI only)

On Linux only, the GUI requires [GTK3](https://www.gtk.org/) headers to build.

Linux (Debian-based):
```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
```

## Build & Run

CLI:
```
cargo run --release --bin jgenesis-cli -- -f <path_to_rom_file>
```

To view all CLI args:
```
cargo run --release --bin jgenesis-cli -- -h
```

GUI:
```
cargo run --release --bin jgenesis-gui
```

To build with maximum optimizations (better runtime performance + smaller binary size at the cost of long compile time):
```
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native" cargo build --profile release-lto
```
...After which the executables will be in `target/release-lto/`.
